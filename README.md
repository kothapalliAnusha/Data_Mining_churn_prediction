Welcome to our churn prediction project repository! This project aims to revolutionize customer retention strategies in the Over-the-Top (OTT) industry by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict subscriber churn with exceptional accuracy.

Overview:
In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital entertainment, maintaining subscriber loyalty is paramount for the sustained success of OTT platforms. This project delves into the intricate dynamics of subscriber behavior, uncovering key insights and leveraging predictive analytics to anticipate churn tendencies.

Key Features:

Data-driven Insights: We meticulously analyzed a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, meticulously cleaning and validating it to ensure reliability. This dataset encompasses a myriad of subscriber attributes, including demographics, usage patterns, and satisfaction metrics.
Machine Learning Modeling: Employing a diverse array of machine learning algorithms, including ensemble methods such as random forest and XG Boost, we developed robust churn prediction models. Additionally, advanced techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) were utilized to address class imbalance issues.
Enhanced Predictive Capabilities: Our project goes beyond traditional churn prediction approaches by incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as LSTM and MLP. By harnessing the power of deep learning, we achieved unparalleled accuracy in forecasting subscriber churn.
Insightful Results: Through rigorous analysis, we uncovered significant factors influencing churn behavior, ranging from service quality perceptions to demographic trends. These insights lay the groundwork for proactive retention strategies and targeted interventions.
Future Directions:
As we continue to innovate in the field of churn prediction, our future endeavors will focus on integrating AI-driven solutions such as chatbots and gamification techniques. By harnessing the potential of real-time analytics and personalized retention strategies, we aim to redefine customer engagement in the OTT ecosystem.
